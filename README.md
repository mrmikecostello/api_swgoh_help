# api_swgoh_help
Python code for the API at https://api.swgoh.help/
Api is developed pretty fast so follow it's documentation for changes, I would be able to update this code only irregularly.

## Usage

          creds = settings('your_username','your_password')
          client = SWGOHhelp(creds)

#careful, allycode is integer, not string
          
          allycode = 997393984

          player = client.get_data('player',allycode)
          print(player)

          guild = client.get_data('guild',allycode)
          print(guild)

          units = client.get_data('units',allycode)
          print(units)

          battles = client.get_data('battles',allycode)
          print(battles)

#data is different - there the second value is not allycode but chosen collection name:
          
          data = client.get_data('data','abilityList')
          print(data)
